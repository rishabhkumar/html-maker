html-maker
==========

This may help in improving the skills of a Beginner HTML scriptwriter as this Software helps in making it easy to see and write code 'simultaneously' . Though the coding for the same was damn boring, but it's kind of similar to what Mozilla Thimble does and not way cooler, but yes way more code-able. One can't run the script of HTML on thimble if it's tag is un-closed whereas one can do that in here!
